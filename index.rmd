In our quest to help communities maximize their potential, we couldnâ€™t help but try and understand how communities work at a deeper level.

- What dynamics govern them?
- How does an average community evolve?
- And, most importantly, how does one start a community around an interest or a goal?

To answer these questions, we started putting together this community building playbook as a public good. And we invite you to co-create it with us!

Distilling community building into a formula is futile and also not our intention here. Instead, we aim to open a two-way dialogue with the reader and discuss the general direction we should move in. As a result, this public good may seem incomplete, and it shall always be so.

As community members, we know the infinite ways in which communities rise and fall. Technological developments often disrupt established processes and ground rules and add to this complexity. As a result, the community building meta keeps changing.

The rules of building a decentralized, digital community differ from those of building an irl one. This playbook focuses on the former type of communities and highlights the concepts and practices that have worked in this domain.

We invite you to share your experiences so we may refine this playbook and make it a possible reference point for the community builders of tomorrow. ðŸ˜„
