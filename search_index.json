What dynamics govern them? How does an average community evolve? And, most importantly, how does one start a community around an interest or a goal? To answer these questions, we started putting together this community building playbook as a public good. And we invite you to co-create it with us! Distilling community building into a formula is futile and also not our intention here. Instead, we aim to open a two-way dialogue with the reader and discuss the general direction we should move in. As a result, this public good may seem incomplete, and it shall always be so. As community members, we know the infinite ways in which communities rise and fall. Technological developments often disrupt established processes and ground rules and add to this complexity. As a result, the community building meta keeps changing. The rules of building a decentralized, digital community differ from those of building an irl one. This playbook focuses on the former type of communities and highlights the concepts and practices that have worked in this domain. We invite you to share your experiences so we may refine this playbook and make it a possible reference point for the community builders of tomorrow. üòÑ "],["introduction-to-the-series.html", "Introduction to the Series The Imperative of Our Times Taking a Closer Look What sustains a community? The Illusion of Control Moving Forward", " Introduction to the Series Together is a wonderful place to be. ‚Äî Dwayna Litz Computer Chronicles ‚Äî The Internet (1993) The Imperative of Our Times The Whole Earth ‚ÄôLectronic Link, or The WELL, is one of the oldest virtual communities that is still operational. Launched in 1985, it grew to 7,000 members and a staff of 12 full-time employees with a gross annual income of $2 million in just eight short years. These are interesting statistics, considering how the foundations of the modern-day internet ‚Äî that enable such communities ‚Äî didn‚Äôt exist at the time. One participant of The WELL, Howard Rheingold, wrote a book aptly titled The Virtual Community, where he discussed the vagaries of life pertaining to online communities. The book‚Äôs prescience is uncanny. Terminally online people, constant trolling, being there for each other, and even finding love were as common back then as they are now. What‚Äôs more interesting, though, was the focus of Howard‚Äôs work. He wanted to investigate what made a digital message stream into a community as good as any other. When a conversation is stripped of its social cues, how does one create a feeling of warmth with words? This series on community building tries to answer this question in detail. Exiting the domains of Big Tech, people today are increasingly turning away from mindless consumption. In a world of remote everything, people are seeking and creating communities that do things. Be it WSB traders, DAO contributors, or activists in Signal groups, the meta of the times has been participating in and growing communities. This could be attributed partly to the nature of things ‚Äî narratives that provide meaning to our lives have withered, leading to increased isolation. The family that shared a single TV is now sitting separately with their screens. Technology has gone from a facilitator of ‚Äúreal-life‚Äù activity to a replacement of it. As a result, we are now finding meaning in these screens, which has turned participating in and growing virtual communities an imperative for our well-being. Taking a Closer Look There are several peculiarities to virtual communities. They are like data streams, sustained by prompt replies, a medium where multiple people can talk simultaneously and still make sense. Despite this, owing to the constancy of human nature, virtual communities aren‚Äôt much different from ‚Äúreal-life‚Äù communities. They each have their set of participatory and initiation rituals and rules that facilitate the entry of the new and the exit of the old. They also go through the same stages of growth ‚Äî ones that we will discuss in more detail in the upcoming articles ‚Äî and face some of the same issues. To be best prepared to understand and tackle these issues, we must closely examine some of the key ideas behind communities. Communities are Gestalts Great communities are gestalts, providing members with value they cannot access or create on their own. This is best witnessed in our usage on social media. A great chunk of the value of web2 social media, especially of UGC applications such as TikTok, Instagram or YouTube lie in the communities they foster. The comments sections of each post indirectly add to your experience of consuming that piece of content. You may be able to consume that content elsewhere, but you certainly won‚Äôt get the same value out of doing so. web2 social media comments sections ‚Äî content can be consumed anywhere, but the community is only on the platform. Communities are Living Beings The best communities are participatory and emergent, and the best community builders approach their work as gardeners instead of builders. Taking this analogy forward, a great way to think about communities is by thinking about slime molds. That is to say, a community is never ‚Äúcomplete.‚Äù It will always be messy and ever-evolving, and each stage is beautiful in its own right. Slime Mold Grows Network Just Like Tokyo Rail System Communities are Spaces Objectively seen, communities create spaces. The primary purpose of a space is to maintain a specific atmosphere for the people within, not the exclusion of those outside of it. A space is thus defined by its boundaries and rules that classify everyone into in-groups and out-groups. This is a key concept to grasp. If you approach spaces created by communities as something exclusionary, you create vulnerable communities with extrinsically motivated members who just aim to look good. However, if you approach these spaces created by communities as something that protects a certain energy, you create robust communities with intrinsically motivated members who are there for authentic connection. What sustains a community? Your community‚Äôs garden must be tended to regularly. These are vital activities that sustain communities in the long run. Narrative Building CCommunities that achieve things have compelling narratives greater than any one individual. It is a north star that attracts the right kind of people and facilitates decision-making and coordinated action. The only thing more important than a compelling narrative, though, is the ability of members to contribute to it. Fortunately, the nature of virtual communities facilitates discussion and enables groups to decide and act on agreed-upon goals collectively. The strongest communities encourage members to ‚Äútake the story forward.‚Äù Sharing Power Like how a gardener must be careful in placing seeds to ensure all of them have healthy growth, community stewards must be mindful of giving each member the space to grow fully. This means allowing each member to ‚Äútake charge‚Äù and cultivate a space that considers everyone‚Äôs opinions at all times. Today, the lines between a customer, a contributor, and a community member are more blurred than ever. Communities that acknowledge invisible power dynamics and address them go the furthest. Iterative Processes As communities grow, it becomes more and more challenging to arrive at a consensus and get stuff done. That is why iterative processes focusing on consistent output close the loops faster and fight stagnation. A ‚Äúgood enough‚Äù mindset is better than ‚Äúthe best.‚Äù Good enough work, iterated upon, has a higher chance of achieving its true potential than work that is painstakingly created trying to perfect every detail (or even just a few). There was a fellow who kind of ran the mailing list, who died a few years ago by the name of Jon Postel, and everybody trusted him not to be in a particular faction. The philosophy behind the people who created the internet was rough consensus and running code. So the rough consensus is essential because anyone who‚Äôs participated in consensus-based activities that begin after strict agreement finds that they go on and on and on. The Illusion of Control Around the same time as The WELL, the first iterations of a metaverse were created by Lucasfilm in Habitat. Users controlled their avatars that moved around in a virtual world. In a paper published by the programmers of Lucasfilm Habitat, titled The Lessons of Lucasfilm‚Äôs Habitat, Chip Morningstar and F. Randall Farmer talked about designing and managing this virtual community of tens of thousands of people. Their main lesson from working on the project is as follows: ‚Ä¶*detailed central planning is impossible; don‚Äôt even try it. Create the tools for users to build their society, and let the users tell you what they want to do because that is what the users‚Ä¶will do, no matter how hard you try to structure some other purpose. The more people we involved in something, the less in control we were. We shifted into a style of operations in which we let the players themselves drive the direction of the design. This proved far more effective. Instead of trying to push the community in the direction we thought it should go, an exercise like herding mice, we tried to observe what people were doing and aid them in it.* &gt; As community stewards, our job is to set the necessary context and background for a community to flourish. Initially, it may feel like you are in control since nothing happens that makes you think otherwise. But as your community grows, you realize that the only way to reconcile the ensuing chaos is to give up any idea of control and aid the community in doing what it wants to do. A fractal view of belonging Moving Forward Any community goes through four critical stages in its lifecycle. This series has four more articles, each concerned with one of the four stages. In this piece, we touched upon the history of virtual communities, our learnings from these experiments, and critical approaches to growing communities. We must look at any community as a garden ‚Äî an organic space that is ever-evolving and ever-changing. We need to have a compelling narrative that members can contribute to. We must consciously try to share power and always favor what‚Äôs ‚Äúgood enough‚Äù over ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs perfect.‚Äù So what does such an approach to community building look like? In the following posts, we shall go into the weeds, introducing new concepts, walking you through tactical exercises, and informing you about key roadblocks to expect and watch out for. LFG! üöÄ "],["phase-1-the-desert.html", "Phase 1: The Desert Setting the Stage Time to Perform! Common Roadblocks Conclusion", " Phase 1: The Desert The journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step. ‚Äî Laozi This desert might seem familiar. Phase 1 of any community is best defined as wandering in the desert. The ‚Äúcommunity‚Äù has three or fewer members. It could also just be you, an idea that isn‚Äôt fully fleshed out yet, and a lot of confusion. Setting the Stage At this stage, the best thing to do is establish key operating behaviors and mental frames¬†of mind¬†that¬†will help you recruit the first believers to your mission. Creating a space All interactions create a space. The nuances and details of the interaction set the atmosphere of this space. Let‚Äôs take an example from our daily lives. The space created when a group of friends gets together is very different from the one created when they meet individually. This is because their interactions have vastly different details and nuances despite inhabiting the shared space (as group members). When the details and nuances of interaction are consistent, the space has a constant atmosphere that fosters bonding. When these are inconsistent, we see the breakdown of a group into several sub-groups where interactions are¬†consistent. Being objective and intentional in your interactions increases the chance of maintaining a consistent atmosphere. This has a positive effect that compounds over time. Building a narrative Communities exist because they fill a void that members can‚Äôt fill themselves. This could be doing something ambitious, feeling seen and heard, exploring interests further, or anything else. Ambitious goals require teams of people to achieve them. Feeling seen and heard requires attentive ears and a safe space. Exploring interests requires exposure to experts and beginners alike, which unlocks new perspectives and a deeper understanding. All of this is only possible in communities, never alone. A straightforward narrative easily conveys the value members can expect to get from the community. It also does a great job of setting the right expectations and separating people who are casually interested from those that are genuinely interested. Approaching work The best way to think about growing a community is to think about raising children. Everything you teach them needs to be constantly updated and reinforced. Simply saying something once isn‚Äôt enough. You must make an effort every day to emphasize your values until they get embedded in the ‚Äúspace,‚Äù and you must prepare and address the needs of today. So you must be intentional in your approach to working for your community. Since there is a high chance that all interactions (or most of them) are online and exist solely in digital communication channels, it is imperative to maintain objectivity and clarity in your communications. Time to Perform! Activity 1: How do you show up to yourself? ‚ÑπÔ∏è Creating spaces Remember, the point of a space is to create an atmosphere conducive to operating in and growing your community. This means it starts at the individual level, with you. How you show up to yourself and your various roles is how you show up to your community. Observing yourself as a group and noticing the various interactions is quite revealing. One way to immediately become aware of this is to be conscious when reasoning. When thinking through things, we often give conflicting parts of our minds distinct personalities. For example, you have probably used some version of the following: ‚Äúthis part of me wants X, but this part of me wants Y. Given this, I must look also consider‚Ä¶‚Äù Write down the various parts that make ‚Äúyou.‚Äù These could be the roles you play (a friend, a parent, a teacher, etc.) Or your various motivations and desires (I want to read this book, but I also want to go out with my friends). Notice the interactions between these various parts. Are you combative or collaborative? (for example, do you often resolve conflicting desires with harsh words like ‚ÄúNo, we will not do this!‚Äù or in some other way?) When you favor a certain part, is it out of domination or a place of understanding? (for example, the teacher in you wants to reprimand the disruptive student, but the friend in you wants to laugh at what they said.) If there are others in your community now, get everyone to do this exercise individually and share the results with each. It will not only deepen your understanding of each other, but it will also help in communicating better. Activity 2: What are you getting people excited about? ‚ÑπÔ∏è Building narratives A strong narrative is like insurance. Dire times reveal its actual value. A good narrative keeps community members intrinsically motivated and attracts new members simultaneously. ‚ÄúIf you want to build a ship, don‚Äôt drum up the men to gather wood, divide the work, and give orders. Instead, teach them to yearn for the vast and endless sea.‚Äù ‚Äî¬†Antoine de Saint-Exup√©ry Ideally, you want your community to grow because there is something you cannot do alone. What is this? Create a one-line summary that explicitly states your¬†goals and motivations. ‚ÄúI want to be surrounded by people that share my niche interest of X.‚Äù Now imagine for a minute that you successfully gathered this kind of people. What type of work will you do together? What will that lead to? ‚ÄúA group of people that share this interest will get together, and A, B, and C¬†activities will have P, Q, and R¬†effects on the world. The effect you will have on the world becomes your narrative. If I am surrounded by people who share my niche interest in Pokemon, we shall participate in and conduct events, fund relevant projects, and contribute to the franchise by creating content. This will introduce a broader audience to our interest and provide them community and entertainment. The above, distilled into your narrative, becomes ‚Äî we are expanding the Pokemon fandom around the world. Remember, the best narratives evolve with community participation. As your community grows, it will collectively decide to focus on something slightly different or even completely different. So while you must think, spend only a little time here. Activity 3: Spread the word. Now that you have clarity create a content strategy around your narrative and post on Twitter, Lens, and Farcaster. Activity 4: How do you participate in your community? ‚ÑπÔ∏è Working smart Setting a healthy, intentional approach to working goes a very, very long way. It is tempting to ‚Äújust get it done‚Äù when it‚Äôs just you or you and a couple of others. But not spending time on this is like extending a line of credit which will be due once your community grows. Having said that, it‚Äôs the early stages, so clarity and brevity are essential. Making a laundry list of rituals, values, and processes will backfire and dilute your existing motivation. It is ideal to stick to a few ‚Äî think hard about what you care about ‚Äî and be open to changing or adding to these as your community grows. Discover the core value(s) of your community. Everyone and every group have some set of values that they never compromise on. These could be explicit or implicit. Try to notice the patterns in yourself and those around you. Do you try to finish things as soon as you can? Are you over-communicative in your interactions? Do you try to be thorough in everything you do? Do you tolerate ambiguity well? It is easier to notice the patterns in others than in yourself. If it‚Äôs just you right now, ask your friends and families about ways to describe you. Consciously set rituals. Rituals bring a sense of stability to a community. Good rituals make members feel heard and indirectly direct member behavior. Ideally, you should have an initiation ritual and a connection ritual. Initiation rituals define how you welcome new members to your community. Ideally, this should be a two-way interaction. For example, new members must collect a Mirror post and collectively introduce themselves to the group. On the other side, all members must try to reach out to the new member individually. The best initiation rituals are memorable. For example, you could have all your existing members change their Twitter profile picture to the new member‚Äôs for a week. Who said it couldn‚Äôt be fun? They foster a certain bond among community members outside of the context of ‚Äúwork.‚Äù Good connection rituals manage the expectations of members. This could be a weekly call where members take turns sharing what‚Äôs on their minds ‚Äî Did anything unexpected happen in your interactions this week? is there something insignificant that is bothering you? The way someone replied, or something they did that is trivial but made you make a note of it. Was participating in this community this week an exciting challenge or a daunting task? Activity 5: Create your manifesto. Your community narrative and your values make up your manifesto. If you have done the above exercises diligently, preparing this won‚Äôt take long. Next, create a collectible Mirror post of this manifesto (ideally free) and personally send it to all your existing Twitter followers. Common Roadblocks For the love of the immortal snail Communities, in the beginning, are ideas, and ideas die a slow death. Keeping your community alive requires consistent effort to keep the vision alive. This is harder than it seems. When there are just one, two, or three people, everyone‚Äôs behaviors and outlook have an outsize impact on the team‚Äôs motivation. The good days are excellent, and the bad days are terrible. So all challenges in this stage pertain to maintaining motivation. The only way to navigate this phase thus is to uphold your values rigorously and religiously partake in rituals. This will ground you and help you maintain a baseline level of motivation to keep the idea alive. Take an iterative approach to everything and focus on ‚Äúdone good enough‚Äù instead of ‚Äúdone perfectly.‚Äù Iterations feel¬†good and keep the morale high. Think of it like taking the stairs vs.¬†jumping directly. The latter is no doubt faster and sometimes more fun, but it might break your legs and is not a strategy for the long run. Conclusion By now, you should have set the stage to spread your mission and recruit early believers. You have a clear idea of what you are doing and a sustainable, healthy way of working and growing your community. You also have a tiny presence on social media (like Twitter, Farcaster, and Lens) and a manifesto that introduces the world to your community. Hopefully, the bedrock of your community strengthens over time, and you chip off at work, one day at a time, one task at a time. Eventually, there comes a point when your team starts growing. You slowly double in size and reach a team of five or six people. Things change ‚Äî some for the better, some for the worse ‚Äî and you must keep up. Let‚Äôs learn how. "],["phase-2-the-valley.html", "Phase 2: The Valley Setting the Stage Time to Perform! Common Roadblocks Conclusion", " Phase 2: The Valley ‚ÄúPoliteness is the poison of collaboration.‚Äù ‚Äî Edwin Land McMurdo Dry Valleys Phase 2 is best defined as the dip. Your initial enthusiasm and energy have slowly worn off, and your motivations are tested by the day. Sure, you are not stumbling in the dark ‚Äî you know where you‚Äôre going, and you have a strong team of five or six members that have made tangible progress. But things have suddenly become complex and have taken a different shape. You are now in the valley. Setting the Stage The meta of navigating the valley is addressing the newfound complexity in your community. This comes in two forms ‚Äî the first is internal complexity. Your community has essentially doubled in size, which has increased coordination costs. Arriving at consensus takes longer, and you might see in-groups forming in your community. The second is external complexity. All the context you set in the beginning ‚Äî while essential to reach here ‚Äî now stands questioned. For example, your narrative might not have had the expected impact or may have attracted those more interested in spectating rather than participating. Here are some frameworks and concepts to remember as you navigate the valley. Fostering your community The first outside people to join your community are unique because they were solely attracted by your community‚Äôs potential. Joining a community at this stage implies high levels of intrinsic motivation since they are few to no external benefits or bragging rights of joining any community so early. At this stage, speaking to the intrinsically motivated parts of your members (rather than their extrinsically motivated parts) is of utmost importance. This is best done by highlighting and appreciating each member individually and publicly for their contributions. At the same time, you should put some effort into defining different ways people could get involved to reduce the distance from a new member to an active contributor. Such pathways provide templates to collect social capital, making people jump to action. The open-source community is a wonderful example of this. Since practically all issues are open and all PRs are default visible, members visibly collect social capital by contributing to repositories. The ultimate validation comes in the form of a merged pull request. Setting decision-making processes As communities scale, attaining a perfect consensus gets exponentially more challenging. But most of the time, a perfect agreement isn‚Äôt even needed. The time spent arguing about the theoretical best decision is traded off for concretely slower execution. Therefore, a good enough decision-making process is often sufficient. What does this look like, though? A decision-making process focussed on Schelling points is an excellent strategy for most communities. In reality, each individual has a different way of calculating the cost vs.¬†benefit of specific decisions. So it is difficult to have everyone agree upon the ‚Äúbest‚Äù outcome to choose/vote for. Instead, if everyone bases their decision on what they think everyone else will choose, we arrive at consensus faster. Having a consistent, clear North star, i.e., your community‚Äôs agreed-upon goal, also makes decision-making much more manageable. Resolving conflicts If you have been working hard, you have probably already seen an intense disagreement or two in your community. Depending on how agreeable your members are, this would have either ended in reluctant giving in, followed by both parties holding grudges, or a massive blow-up that created a rift in your community. But conflict is not necessarily a bad thing! If anything, it is a sign that people care. This is the right stage to create a ritual, a process around conflict resolution. This should always focus on the reconciliation of the differing factions, and never an investigation or a judgment of who was at fault. While an inclusive conflict resolution process is excellent for matters of the community, you need a slightly different approach to interpersonal conflicts that leave either party unable to express themselves fully. A good start is for the leaders, i.e., community founders or other senior members, to hold a safe space where members can come forth and share their concerns, trivial or grave. This is also the right time to set formal rules around interpersonal behavior in your community. Time to Perform! The exponential increase in the complexity of everything defines the valley. Things are more challenging than you expected them to be. This is normal. Finish the following activities to maintain your sanity when the going gets tough. Activity 6: Where does your community reside? ‚ÑπÔ∏è Fostering community Fostering your community is best seen from various perspectives. The first order of business is creating a formal, shared space where your community can congregate. Clean up or create a new Discord server. Have different channels for different purposes. Ideally, you should start with the least number of channels possible and only add more when existing channels are overflowing with activity. Too many channels with little to no activity make your server seem dead. This means you should have a general channel where anyone can come and message. A gm channel where everyone sends daily gm‚Äôs, and an off-topic channel to share memes, music/TV show recs, discuss interests, etc. In addition to this, you should have two channels where only the admins can send messages. The first such channel should specify the server rules, linking members to your community‚Äôs social media, and answering FAQs. The second one should be a space for full-time contributors discuss work matters. Chances are that the most active channel in your server will be the one where the core team discusses work-related matters. This channel will be the one new members will be most curious to see. Therefore, keep this visible to all, and be very intentional in how you communicate with each other. Remember, you are always indirectly telling people what behaviors are expected, encouraged, and tolerated. Activity 7: Define the paths of involvement. At this stage, you should set clear paths with different levels of involvement for members. The paths should be exponential, i.e., each successive path should have much more work and reward than the previous one. What are some ways people can participate in your community? What is the easiest way to participate in your community? This could be as simple as interacting with your posts or creating social media content. For example, members could translate articles, create TikToks or explainers, etc. Ideally, you should have three paths. The first path should be something anyone can follow with just a few minutes of daily investment. The second path would ideally require a couple of hours a week. The third path would require an hour or more per day. This is also a great way to spread the word about your community and discover your most enthusiastic members. When expanding your team, you should choose from this pool first. Activity 8: Allow everyone to lead. The best communities consist of leaders. Empowering everyone with an opportunity to lead does wonders for your community dynamic and makes you more resilient. Create a ritual where community members get to lead in turns. You could, for example, choose a different member to host your weekly internal calls. You could also involve your top contributors in critical meetings, and take their opinions in meta-admin matters. Decide and create a totem for your community. Present the community with the task of creating a totem for itself. This could be an NFT, a physical object, an event, or anything else. The idea is to get the community to work out the details and execute the task together. From choosing the format to the design to the actual creation and then its distribution (if so required) ‚Äî these are all opportunities for people to hone and display their leadership skills. Activity 9: How do you make decisions? ‚ÑπÔ∏è Making decisions The faster your decision-making, the longer your community will survive. This is because making decisions inject energy into your community. They are a marker of movement and progress, and the best motivator for any community member. Figure out what quick decision-making means for your community. Remember, you can only know the true efficacy of a decision in hindsight. Sometimes, we get lost in weighing the pros and cons, and in trying to find the theoretical best option, we indirectly choose concretely slower execution. This saps your community‚Äôs morale, which is a far more accurate predictor of your community‚Äôs death than making a wrong decision. Introduce the idea of Schelling points. Promote a decision-making process that encourages members to think about what others are most likely to decide, and then choose that option or from that set of options (instead of thinking, evaluating the options first, and then selecting from them). There is a high degree of divergence in what everyone considers the best option. However, there is low-to-moderate convergence in what everyone thinks others will find to be the best option. Thinking in terms of Schelling points either makes the decision for you or narrows down your options and takes you closer to making a decision. Finally, document your process. Create a separate document that summarises your decision-making processes. This should fit on a page and can be added to your manifesto. This will benefit the new members in understanding how things are done in your community and will be a helpful reference point in times of confusion or disagreement. Activity 10: Set up a governance process. Decide how to give governance power in your community. This is best done through membership NFTs since these are easy to set up and manage as your community grows. rep3‚Äôs platform enables communities to set up membership badges and a Gnosis Safe in a few clicks, which saves you the trouble of figuring out and setting these up separately. Membership NFT-based governance also doesn‚Äôt require much upfront setup like that needed to launch a token (deciding on supply, creating liquidity pools, fair distribution, etc.) and it also shields your community from governance attacks. Lastly, this is also an excellent time to set up token-gated spaces for your community, starting with token-gated channels on Discord, and exploring token-gated collaboration tools such as Clarity or Charmverse in the future. Choose a platform where members can show up and vote. We suggest using Snapshot since it is the default for all communities and is the easiest to set up. This is also the right time to set a formal proposal process that encourages members to share ideas, form comprehensive proposals, and present them to the community. Activity 11: Elect an ombudsperson in your community. ‚ÑπÔ∏è Resolving conflicts As mentioned above, conflicts are a natural part of working and living in groups. It is not the conflict but the community‚Äôs response to it that has path-altering effects on its trajectory. The idea of all conflict resolution is to reconcile by returning to a point where everyone is in harmony. The ideal fperson is the individual the community deems impartial enough to resolve conflicts. Have your community vote upon and decide upon an ombudsperson. Work closely with this person to propose a conflict-resolution playbook documenting the process. A sample process could look like this ‚Äî the parties involved submit a description of the facts of the event and their interpretations of it. The ombudsperson then reviews these decisions and discusses them with the two parties, starting with getting them to agree on facts and then reconciling their differences. Activity 12: Define your community‚Äôs code of conduct. Prevention is better than cure. It is much easier to define and nudge your members toward proper ways of conducting themselves in the community than addressing someone breaking the code of conduct. A code of conduct is just a solidified, objective and thorough description of your values. In addition to that, it should also list the basics, i.e., complete intolerance of any discrimination (based on religion, gender of choice, perceived skill level, etc.) and behavior that may contribute to creating an unhealthy atmosphere (unwelcome sexual attention, harassment or trolling, bullying people or taking sides, etc.) *Be extremely clear about escalation practices. Having a code of conduct that is not enforced is worse than having one that is. For example, institute a warning system where each digression from the code of conduct is taken as one warning. Then, please make it so it is easy for everyone to track the warnings of members without knowing what they were warned for. This could be done through badges conveying a warning without more details. You could also institute bans instead of or along with a warning system. As founding members of the community, it is imperative to hold safe spaces for anyone and everyone to come forth and share their concerns, no matter how trivial or grave. Ensure you and the ombudsperson are aligned, and communicate it frequently with the community. Activity 13: Revisit activity 1. In communities, the earliest members often set the tone of interactions for everyone that comes after. New members often look at the communication patterns of early members to see what is accepted and what isn‚Äôt. Here, your actions speak much, much louder than your words. Whatever precedent you set for your community, there is a high chance that someone takes it to its extremes. For example, if you have a culture of tolerating playful banter, then down the line, you will see someone or the other take it to its extreme and outright troll or bully someone. Or, if you have a culture of shipping fast and turning around things quickly, sometimes people will not even adhere to the bare minimum standard of quality. Take a step back and think hard about this. You ideally do not have to change yourself entirely for your community. You just need to be careful in upholding boundaries or standards. That‚Äôs why the most significant communities have zero tolerance for things common in small groups of people, simply because it broadens the ‚Äúgrey area,‚Äù where most transgressions of a community‚Äôs code of conduct lie. Remember, people are more concerned with not looking bad in front of their peers than getting praise. Often, not acknowledging and encouraging unwanted behavior by anyone is a powerful way to prevent transgressions of your code of conduct or address them swiftly if they ever happen. Common Roadblocks The Dip by Seth Godin A community in the valley stage slowly exposes itself to reality for the first time. This can be an arduous process to navigate. Things might feel like they are not working or breaking down when in fact, they are. When in doubt, always consider whether the reason can be attributed to internal or external complexity. Chances are, the roadblock you face is ideally a result of both internal and external complexity. The aim, then, is to do what you can control. You always have control over how you work and approach problems. Focus on this. Set, revisit, or revise processes. Consciously steer your culture. Getting right to ‚Äúwhat matters‚Äù and moving on to the next thing may be tempting. But the importance of spending time on your culture in this stage cannot be overstated. This may just be the last time you have any control over it. Conclusion Contrary to the first stage, where things seem ‚Äúup only,‚Äù a valley starts with a decline and eventually ends up with things looking better. You go from a small unit of five or six people to two small units of this size. Your community going forth is now best seen as a collection of similar-sized units. If you have been careful, you have templatized this growth process. You would have also become comfortable putting yourself out there and learned the value of feedback gained from exposing your ideas to the world. You have probably revisited some aspect of your narrative or values, and you have a space that your community calls home. You also have processes for collective decision-making and transparently managing your finance. Your mission seems to have the potential to resonate with people ‚Äî and not because you think so, but because you have signs that point in this direction. Things will soon pick up the pace, and how you look at your community will change. You wil soon enter the carnival. "],["phase-3-the-carnival.html", "Phase 3: The Carnival Setting the Stage Time to Perform! Common Roadblocks Conclusion", " Phase 3: The Carnival ‚ÄúNo one can whistle a symphony. It takes a whole orchestra to play it.‚Äù ‚Äì H.E. Luccock Carnival Chaos Communities that don‚Äôt die in the desert usually die in the valley. And the ones that die in neither see their persistence rewarded by reaching the carnival. It is fun and exciting, to say the least. A welcome change. Your narrative has found its audience, however small that may be. There is a regular pace at which your community is adding more members. You may even see a spike in your social media engagement. Now, the mindset that sustained you in the desert and the valley is of little use. This is because the carnival is a phase of abundance. Opportunities that seemed scarce ‚Äî like those to recruit people or fill your treasury ‚Äî are available in plenty. Let‚Äôs take a closer look. Setting the Stage It is tempting to overindulge in the carnival. Your community might want to spend more money and do more things. At the same time, things move faster than ever. More members join by the day, which brings the risk of diluting your community‚Äôs atmosphere. Sticking to the plan is the key to making the most of the carnival. This does not mean not trying new things, but in a space full of distractions, it always helps to remember what you initially set out to do. Encouraging participation Today, the lines between a customer, a contributor, and a community member are more blurred than ever. Customers who come for the product or service may join the community and contribute to its mission. People that participate as contributors may become customers. Your job as the community leader now is facilitating an environment where people easily drift between being customers, contributors, and community members. This means your leadership must feel like a party host instead of a troop leader. Leadership as hospitality is all about making people comfortable and included. In this regard, you must ensure that people have ample opportunities to add to the conversation or contribute to a project with little to no friction. Acknowledging outliers Power laws apply everywhere, and they apply to your community too. As you grow, you need to develop the skill to discern members with an outsized impact on things. This need not necessarily be in terms of output. Some people might be great at shipping ‚Äî which is easy to notice ‚Äî but others are great at uplifting the community or keeping things glued together. Observing these people is an acquired skill. After finding these people, make sure you do everything you can to make them feel acknowledged and appreciated. Demonstrating progress Visible progress is a key driver of motivation. Besides making your community seem lively, it makes it fun and keeps morale high. Demonstrating progress can also go beyond communicating output. It can be done in many ways. A regular cadence of meetings open to the broader public is a great way to do so. The best communities also spend a lot of time documenting and articulating themselves ‚Äî whether in video or text form ‚Äî and putting it out there for the world to see. Time to Perform! Activity 14: Create functional teams. Not having a tall hierarchy does not mean not having a structure. As your community grows, it is vital to structure yourself for maximum productivity. Identify members from your early members to lead these functional teams. The type of functional teams you have depends on what your community intends to do. This is clear by seeing what your early members spend time on when engaging with your community. Regardless of what you do, having a marketing and a governance team is highly advisable. Then, depending on your goals, you could have an engineering team, a design team, a growth team, etc. Cultivate these leaders by helping them run their teams. Leading a functional team is just another version of leading a community. Share your early lessons with team leaders and inform them of any roadblocks they may face. Activity 15: Create a check-in ritual. Leadership as hospitality means you must ensure everyone is having a good time. Encourage pod leaders to view their role as party hosts. Without asking, how can they know whether a member is enjoying themself or not? What is the equivalent of sitting alone in a corner and using your phone in your community? This could be someone suddenly stopping their daily gm‚Äôs. Or someone that is thorough and thoughtful in their responses gradually losing interest. Or it could be this person not reacting to the same number of messages as before, or not sharing the same volume of memes or music recs. Such vibe shifts manifest itself in many ways. Look for patterns and try to notice if people break them. While we all have our bouts of not feeling up to the mark, if you see someone withdrawing from your community, checking in with them is probably a good idea. Activity 16: Who are the pillars of your community? ‚ÑπÔ∏è Identifying outliers Community members with an outsized impact are the engine of sustenance. Acknowledging them goes a long way. You need to look hard at your community to identify these outliers. Who are the people that take the most amount of initiative? Who are the people that have the highest and most visible impact on community output? There might be a developer that pumps out PR after PR or a contributor that always has new content ideas. Others seem unproductive and more ‚Äúbehind the scenes,‚Äù yet they command the most respect or power in your community. Some outliers could also look like people whose presence lights up the whole space. This could be due to their nature or just how they conduct themselves. They always have something to say and leave the chat buzzing with action. Activity 17: Appreciate and acknowledge the effort of your outliers. There are several ways of appreciating and acknowledging your members. Publicly recognize your members, but be careful not to overdo it. There is a particular influence early members have in any community. As community founders, even though you may not have much power on paper, what you say holds a lot of weight in your community. Use this to your benefit. Publicly recognize the outstanding effort of your community members. But be sparing in your appreciation. Too much, and you risk reducing its impact. Having said that, don‚Äôt shy away from individually appreciating members. Do this as much as you can. It will make them feel good and make your members more open to critical feedback. If possible, create a compensation strategy to reward members monetarily. When possible, you should always use rewards that intrinsically motivate people. But some people are more extrinsically motivated. For them, earning money is more valuable than a sense of belonging. This is also fine. Monetarily rewarding members makes them take participation more seriously, and may even bump your community up in the list of projects they are involved with. Create a proposal to earmark a portion of your treasury for member contributions. Then, work with team leaders to create and maintain open task boards and processes to evaluate work and disburse payments. Activity 18: Articulate your learnings from growing your community. ‚ÑπÔ∏è Demonstrating progress Don‚Äôt be afraid to get meta when demonstrating progress. One of the best ways of demonstrating progress is to articulate your learnings. People are more intrigued with the backstage details of what you do instead of the things that you actually do.[1] Sharing your learnings is an excellent tactic to market your community to newer audiences subtly. * Create a personal blog commenting on your process as a community steward/founder. * Try to go as specific as you can in these posts. People may not be interested in your community, but they will surely be interested in how they could grow one. Activity 19: Create a regular cadence of progress updates. Make it a point to share anything your community accomplishes or completes at regular, predictable intervals. Post weekly updates. The best manifestation of demonstrating progress is weekly updates. There is something about a community that shares its challenges and what they‚Äôve been up to. Try to open your communication channels to the world. Nothing demonstrates progress like letting the world peep into your office. You may open up the channel where you discuss and execute proposals. Or you can have some of your internal discussions open to the public. This might only be possible for some communities, but there is undoubtedly a version of this that you can implement. Common Roadblocks Sometimes it may feel like this While the valley challenges your commitment, the carnival will question your sanity. All your processes and rituals get battle-tested and reveal interesting things. Your job here is to acknowledge the facts revealed with time and take action if necessary. For example, you may realize that some rituals that worked well in earlier phases don‚Äôt scale or that your workflow requires specific changes. Whatever this may be, consciously analyzing it and thinking about what you can do (and if you should do anything about it) is much better than simply ignoring it. Conclusion While you enter the carnival with two small teams of five to six people, you leave with ten or more such small teams. In a short period, your community has not only doubled but grown manifold. Your treasury has some money in it, no matter the amount. Lively discourse populates your forums. You have a dependable governance process. You have self-managing teams in your community; most importantly, your power as a community founder has diminished. These are all signs of a healthy community. Things have somewhat stabilized ‚Äî dare you say, even plateaued ‚Äî and now you must focus on maintaining and guarding the castle you built. [1] For example, the first thing one wonders when they meet a startup founder is not some specific detail of their company, but rather the backstage or the meta details of how they got started, what issues they faced, etc. The same goes for your community. Sharing your learnings is a great introduction to your community. "],["phase-4-the-village.html", "Phase 4: The Village Setting the Stage Time to Perform! Common Roadblocks Conclusion", " Phase 4: The Village ‚ÄúEven if you‚Äôre on the right track, you‚Äôll get run over if you just sit there.‚Äù ‚Äì Will Rogers A village in Switzerland After the hustle and bustle of the carnival, you arrive at the village. Things are calmer and more predictable. They have also slowed down. New people come, and old people leave in an expected, orderly fashion. You have passed or are going to pass Dunbar‚Äôs number. Chunks of people in your community are completely unaware of each other. You have made a name and a space for yourself. Now is the time to form alliances and explore new territories while maintaining what you have built. Setting the Stage If you have reached this stage, your community has succeeded in making a name and carving out a space for itself. You must now shift your focus to forming alliances and exploring new territories while maintaining what you have built. Maintaining your community Let‚Äôs revisit the idea of communities being gardens. A vibrant and colorful garden requires high levels of maintenance. This means regularly tending to its plants and flowers; periodically removing weeds, insects, and pests; and occasionally fending the wild animal that threatens to walk over and destroy everything. Similarly, you should focus on improving the experience of participating in your community, reinforcing positive behaviors, and looking for the subtle winds of change that could turn into storms in the future. Expanding your influence As your community matures, you either have achieved the goal you initially set out to achieve or find yourself no longer captivated by that mission. In either case, there is a tangible sense of stagnation in your community. You must address this by introducing ideas of expansion and focusing on a different or a bigger goal. Is there a way to play a more significant role in the ecosystem you are a part of? Is there something new on the horizon that you can participate in? In this stage of your community, the bonds among the members are strong enough to survive an update to or a complete change of your north star. Time to Perform! The village is a comfortable place to stay. It is also where most communities go and die. You must continue to fan curiosity and keep the explorer spirit alive. Activity 20: Guarding the gates. ‚ÑπÔ∏è Approaching maintenance Take a closer look at how your community moves. If you have reached the village, the raw experience of participating in your community is validated. Now, you must refine the onboarding and offboarding process. Optimize your onboarding flow. A smooth onboarding flow encourages new members to become participants instead of spectators. Revisit your initiation rituals. Now that you have more resources, how can you improve this experience? Have a regular onboarding call weekly or fortnightly. Assign buddies to each new member to help them navigate the community. Or, personally reach out to new members and schedule a brief conversation. Optimize your offboarding flow. A smooth offboarding flow turns leaving members into assets for the community. How do you ensure that members leave on a good note? Be open to any feedback you receive from exiting members, and do your best to help them go wherever they want to go next. It may not benefit you immediately, but it will create goodwill with exiting members that will pay dividends in due time. Activity 21: Get good at giving and receiving feedback. Remember, community founders have incredible levels of influence and are held in high regard by the community members. As your community grows in this phase, most members view you as the village elder. Use this power wisely. Learn to give great feedback. Great feedback comes from a place of empathy and contributes to the other person‚Äôs growth. Remember, it is about what they did ‚Äî never about who they are. Check your emotions before giving feedback. It is extra important to choose your words carefully since most people on the receiving end of feedback are subconsciously defensive to some extent. You want them to focus on what your say rather than the delivery of it. Be as objective as you can. This means highlighting anything that is out of the ordinary ‚Äî good or bad. Backing your arguments with examples/instances is the most helpful thing you can do. Learn to take great feedback. When seeking feedback, it is vital to be clear about your intentions ‚Äî do you want to know the truth, or are you just seeking approval? Don‚Äôt let having strong opinions about your work shut you from new or different ways to do things. The idea of feedback is to improve the quality of the end product, not make a judgment on your ideas or your working style. A good practice in communities is to set up anonymous polls within pods or teams, where anyone can come and voice their opinions or ideas. Then, the pod of team leads can bring these up with the community and initiate discussion if required. Activity 22: How are things different from the early days? ‚ÑπÔ∏è Take stock of things The people involved in any project grow with it as well. This usually happens in subtle shifts, but after a long time, it is easy to notice these shifts and discover the factors responsible for them. Notice what has changed. Since the community took off, what has changed in your external environment? What are some new things ‚Äî ideas, tools, and technologies ‚Äî that have come up? Internally, what were some unexpected consequences of the decisions your community made? These could be decisions around kicking members, doubling down on a particular bet, creating rituals, etc. For example, you may notice that the vibe of your community changes after highly visible people leave. Note the effect of such a change. Sometimes incentives can optimize for the wrong type of behavior. What are the explicit and implicit incentive structures in your community? What are some ways people have gamed this? What new rituals or processes have sprung up? Are any of them unhealthy or unproductive? Have a system to evaluate new ideas. Communities of this size come with their own set of pros and cons. What is something that your community is the best at? What is something that your community absolutely cannot do? Being aware of your constraints helps you evaluate new ideas ‚Äî they might be great in general, but they could not be the most beneficial path of action for your community. Activity 23: Host or coordinate community-wide events. This one is straightforward ‚Äî digital communities are the closest to emulating the feeling of irl togetherness, but they still cannot replace the real thing. Coordinate an irl meetup for your community members who are open to the idea. This need not even be something on its own ‚Äî a good idea is to meet or host a side event at any tentpole event in your ecosystem. For example, ETH Denver has become a popular event for many crypto communities to gather and meet irl for the first time. Explore attending similar events if all your members are in the same country or continent. Common Roadblocks A situation like this can easily be avoided. The biggest roadblocks to your community‚Äôs progress are politics and stagnation. As your community grows, so do the number of unofficial sub-groups that go on to sow the seeds of destruction. Identify the key members that disrupt your community‚Äôs harmony and try to address their behavior early on. Obviously, mere disagreement or a difference of opinion does not equal disruption. But, individuals that behave in clannish ways or communicate unhealthily are undoubtedly disruptive. Make sure you deal with these individuals early on ‚Äî either by assimilating them into your community or helping them find opportunities they are better suited for. The next roadblock you shall face going forward is falling into the trap of indecisiveness as to what you should focus on. This can be individual as well as communal indecision. The reason behind such hesitation is mostly an outdated way of evaluating opportunities. A certain inertia comes with growth, and this must be dealt with head-on. Conclusion By now, the operations of your community are mostly locked down. You have a rhythm to your social media strategy, you‚Äôre building in public/getting the broader public involved as much as you can (through virtual events, progress reports, and content), and you have a healthy atmosphere in your digital headquarters (which could be Google Workspace and Discord, or a bespoke mix of open source tools). You have a list of rituals that make participation fun, and you have set processes that facilitate idea generation, constructive discussion, and active voting. Congratulations! Most communities that start don‚Äôt live to see this day. But in all communities, big and small, the stages outlined in the previous posts are somewhat common. Sure, the duration of each phase may vary greatly ‚Äî some communities develop on a slow-burn over the years while others bubble up in weeks. It also depends on your community‚Äôs focus. Are you trying to build or improve a product? Are you trying to provide some service? Is it primarily a space for people to discuss a niche interest? All this affects your trajectory and your growth. Also, it can change anytime! The only thing to remember is that any community is like an evolving, living, breathing entity that changes with time. This is a thoughtful comparison. As is with art, no one ‚Äúfinishes‚Äù or ‚Äúperfects‚Äù a community. They simply abandon it. Community building is the greatest art of the 21st century. This is because of two reasons ‚Äî first is the development of communication technology, which makes discovering others with shared interests very quick. Second is the breakdown in traditional community structures that has led to people increasingly finding themselves in their community of choice. Artists, creators, and ideas have unparalleled pull today. It is imperative to take full advantage of this and improve the world.

This is what they had to say! The First 5 How did you attract the earliest members of your community? There was a big marketing push for the token mint, so in our case, the first group of members was those who were attracted to the token mint without any pre-existing familiarity with each other. Speaking about scaling, the founding team planted the flag, but the community (mainly a small handful of community members) defined the vision. As the founding members transitioned out of the DAO, the members who put in the most work and added the most value ended up becoming the core team, and we‚Äôve been steering it ever since. ‚Äì Clinamenic from Lobby3 At the beginning of 2022, I wanted to gain more experience in web3. But like most early career folks, I was priced out of NFT communities. Shortly after, I came across Syndicate and realized that unaccredited creditors could come together in a group and invest in NFTs and tokens. I saw the opportunity to create the community I wanted and quickly sent out a feeler on Twitter about creating a group of young career professionals that would learn and invest in web3 together. The idea resonated with people, and I realized this could be a DAO. Out of all those that reached out, I shortlisted five people after filtering for vibes. They all agreed to join. After this, I asked one of the members to be the second interviewer, tweeted an application form, created a website, and interviewed about 100 people. This way, we onboarded 35 people to Season 1 and used Syndicate to pool $1,000 each. The DAO launched in April when Jakub came on as co-founder, and it‚Äôs been almost three seasons of The Symmetrical since then! ‚Äì Erika and Jakub from The Symmetrical Back in 2017-18, a few early members in the Moloch DAO space realized that much needed to be done to make Moloch DAOs accessible to all. Since UI and I were already working on freelance dev projects through RaidGuild, we decided to make a front-end to interact with the Moloch smart contracts, and so DAOhaus was born as a hackathon project at ETHBerlin 2019! ‚Äì Dekan from DAOhaus Since we were keen on attracting only the most serious members, we knew we had to go down a different route. We tried a lot of platforms, but ultimately what worked the best for us was web3 job boards. We straight up posted job openings there and highlighted the responsibilities and roles of a DAO member in the description. Of course, Myosin members aren‚Äôt restricted to the positions they applied for, but creating job postings helped us filter out a lot of the people we wouldn‚Äôt otherwise have. It worked for us and laid the foundation of our strong team today! ‚Äì Blake from Myosin Like any good project, the first members are usually your friends or family. In our case, the first few members were close friends I spoke with and explained the idea to. They supported the idea and jumped in based on their financial situation. ‚Äì Wasabi from Kokonut Network Since the DAO was essentially summonned by a few folks from MetaCartel (at ETH Denver 2020), our first few members came from MetaCartel and the broader Moloch DAO ecosystem. ‚Äì QuantumAlpha from MetaGammaDelta DAO Culture How would you define your community‚Äôs culture? For starters, we all are excited by what we are doing in/through Lobby3. We also respect each other as individuals, and that has set the grounds for a stable, collaborative culture at Lobby3. One of our fun/weird rituals was doing a series of Twitter Spaces called ‚ÄúStatecraft on Tap,‚Äù where we all drank beer, and I read the Federalist Papers aloud. ‚Äì Clinamenic from Lobby3 We have a Twitter campaign called Product Roasts, where we give feedback to web3 products from a GenZ lens. This helped us put ourselves out there and is consistently acknowledged by product owners and the OGs in the space! We are also fortunate enough to have proactive members in almost every functional area of the DAO that keep the conversation going, so we haven‚Äôt had problems with community morale so far. ‚Äì Erika and Jakub from The Symmetrical We‚Äôve maintained a healthy level of engagement in our community because the core team members are super active inside and outside of the DAO. We frequently interact with each other and the broader DAOhaus community on Discord, sharing their memes, poetry, music recs, blogs, etc. We also have a Haus Party every few weeks on our Discord server. This event is open to all and, honestly, is great vibes. ‚Äì Dekan from DAOhaus Since we have an extensive member screening process presided over by our membership committee, we have a very low acceptance rate (~2%). This has created an exclusive atmosphere in the DAO that no one takes for granted. We also have one of the most consistent gm channels. One day, one of our members created Mylo ‚Äì Myosin‚Äôs own Discord bot ‚Äì to replace the external bot we used to keep track of gm streaks. They also added other quirks to the bot and gamified the process to a point where people started getting competitive about their gm streaks! ‚Äì Blake from Myosin Our DAO members and core contributors are well aware of the significant shift in agriculture catalyzed by web3 and our role in it. This keeps us motivated at all times. Since there is some distinction between the team on the field and the one that looks after the web3 side of things, we make it a point to keep everyone on the same page regarding progress or roadblocks. ‚Äì Wasabi from Kokonut Network One of the pillars of our community, if I may call it that, is our community call. Almost all communities have one, but ours is really special because instead of adding to the information overload and the madness of crypto/web3, it‚Äôs a break away from it all. We don‚Äôt really have fixed or lengthy agendas, and the vibe is like that of a brunch with your best friends. ‚Äì QuantumAlpha from MetaGammaDelta DAO On-chain Strategy What is your on-chain strategy? In the original DAO, we had slightly over 800 unique token holders (a number that doesn‚Äôt account for Sybil attacks). We used ERC-721 transferable tokens at the time. In the new DAO, though (which will be integrated with our new legal entity), we may use non-transferable ERC-1155s or non-transferrable ERC-721s. ‚Äì Clinamenic from Lobby3 As of Season 2, the DAO has 55 members and a treasury of $52,538.61 USDC. On-chain membership to The Symmetrical requires a minimum contribution of $1,000 USDC to get $1,000 TSYM, which gives holders the right to vote among others (like attending events, participating in consulting projects, etc.) ‚Äì Erika and Jakub from The Symmetrical DAOhaus itself runs as a Moloch DAO, so on-chain membership is denoted by membership shares that members receive after their membership proposal is passed and processed. The DAOhaus DAO recently migrated to a more permissionless DAO under the PublicHAUS name. To join, you need to stake your DAOhaus tokens (\\(HAUS) during an open staking period to receive governance power (\\)PUB) over the protocol. Here is a list of our members, and here is how you can get involved! ‚Äì Dekan from DAOhaus On-chain membership and entry to the DAO are mediated by our token ($MYO), which is airdropped to members once they clear their interviews. The DAO currently has 150 members. ‚Äì Blake from Myosin Kokonut Network is a Moloch DAO, so membership to the DAO is denoted via loot and contributor shares. Currently, the DAO has 54 members. ‚Äì Wasabi from Kokonut Network Since we‚Äôre a Moloch DAO, on-chain membership is defined through membership shares. Prospective members must pledge 10 $DAI in their membership proposals, which when passed, grants them entry to the DAO. However, one need not wait to be a member to participate. We have 100 pledgees at the moment, but our Discord server is full of active contributors who aren‚Äôt official members yet! ‚Äì QuantumAlpha from MetaGammaDelta DAO Words of Cheer A few words for budding or fledgling communities. Get involved and experiment! This is an amazing frontier of human coordination and organization practices. ‚Äì Clinamenic from Lobby3 Building a community allows you to bootstrap a global network of participants around something you are passionate about. This is highly empowering and the best way to launch a web3 startup. Start small and determine what you can do well with a small group. Scale once you have this figured out. ‚Äì Erika and Jakub from The Symmetrical Experiment with Moloch DAOs, and don‚Äôt forget why you‚Äôre here. Don‚Äôt give in to centralization, and remember, we can slay Moloch! ‚Äì Dekan from DAOhaus Building a community is hard work with daily grinding, communicating, empathizing, and leading. But persistence is the key, like in so many endeavors. Chart a vision of the world you want to create, and leverage the power of web3 to enable and empower other aligned people so you can all get there together! ‚Äì Blake from Myosin Keep your monthly costs low. Try to do everything in-house. Partner with other builders whenever you don‚Äôt know how to do something. One of the greatest perks of building in web3 is that there‚Äôs no shortage of talent or hungry individuals that want to get stuff done. ‚Äì Wasabi from Kokonut Network Always focus on building relationships and adding value. Work hard, but also be realistic with your commitments and take breaks when your body or mind asks for them. ‚Äì QuantumAlpha from MetaGammaDelta DAO "],["index-of-daos.html", "Index of DAOs Lobby3 The Symmetrical DAOhaus Myosin Kokonut Network MetaGammaDelta DAO", " Index of DAOs Here‚Äôs a quick overview of all the DAOs contributing to this playbook! Lobby3 ‚ö†Ô∏è Quick Tip Unless you are building a blockchain from scratch, decentralizing too early can do more harm than good. Decentralizing over phases is much better! Lobby3 is a decentralized advocacy organization. Their work focuses on the intersection of civics and distributed ledger technology. They aim to spread awareness of the benefits of running communities or organizations in a truly decentralized manner (and how to do so). Lobby3 is a non-profit organization currently forming a Wyoming UNA. The DAO is run by an enthusiastic group of contributors that have long taken over from the founding team. Clinamenic from Lobby3 tells us the impact the bear market has had on their team‚Äôs productivity: ‚Äú‚Ä¶we never had much governance engagement, and the bear market brought that activity down even further, but that worked out well because it allows the core team to focus on building‚Äùin stealth mode,‚Äù which in our case mainly means a lot of tooling set up and entity formation.‚Äù They are pre-revenue right now but have amassed a following of ~7k people on Twitter and have an active Discord with 97 members at the time of writing. Besides being a founding member of the DAO Coalition, they plan to build a decentralized advocacy protocol enabling users to create on-chain campaigns and social movements. The core of this protocol will be the messages that users create, sign, and donate to, which will fund and spread the news of what they‚Äôre supporting. They have secured funding for an MVP and are actively inviting contributors. When asked if there were anything they‚Äôd do differently, this is what Clinamenic had to say: ‚ÄúI expected token holders to pay more attention to governance matters! The token should not have been transferable, and we should have set the voting to quadratic immediately. Also, we decentralized too quickly and had to recentralize to get everything back in order.‚Äù The Symmetrical ‚ö†Ô∏è Quick Tip Your tokenomics is a reflection of your priorities. But, like anything, these change with time. Thus, the best way to bring your community on-chain is to experiment with NFT memberships ‚Äì this requires minimal setup and is easy to change in the future! The Symmetrical is a genZ DAO at the forefront of the internet. The DAO is heavily involved in the intersection of web3 and consumer technology. It invests in NFTs, tokens, and startups and consults with consumer tech. companies with a GenZ focus (helping them create/execute their web3 strategy). Outside of investing and consulting, the DAO actively participates in internet culture through various media channels. The Symmetrical is a few weeks away from finishing its second season (Oct.¬†‚Äô22 to Mar.¬†‚Äô23), and its 55 members currently command a treasury of $52,538.61 USDC. The treasury is fully funded by these members, who collectively decide to spend this money incentivizing contributions, giving grants, and more. The DAO boasts a following of 2,100 people on Lens and prefers using Telegram over Discord/Slack. While it doesn‚Äôt have a stable revenue stream, the DAO has made some revenue from its investments and consulting projects. Of late, they are focussing on ramping up their content production, aiming to monetize this in season 3 to build a bigger audience, increase brand awareness, and attract more sponsors. The Symmetrical has recently launched a sub-DAO centered around collecting media NFTs called Collectible DAO and is responsible for propagating the meme of media NFTs on Crypto Twitter. When asked if there were anything they‚Äôd do differently, this is what Erika and Jakub had to say: ‚ÄúThe biggest surprise was learning that not all DAO members would become active contributors. We had some idea of this, but we would have worked more on incentivizing members to contribute had we known its magnitude.‚Äù DAOhaus ‚ö†Ô∏è Quick Tip In the past couple of years, several Discord communities co-opted the term DAO without actually having on-chain governance. This is a missed opportunity! It takes an hour or so to grasp the fundamentals and about a few minutes to set up on-chain memberships using tools like rep3, Snapshot, etc. Only call yourself a DAO after you understand the value of on-chain governance and memberships. DAOhaus is the protocol for purpose-driven governance. Community managers and founders use DAOhaus to create and manage their DAO. In summary, DAOhaus provides an easy way for people to interact with the Moloch contracts that single-handedly revived the DAO movement after the 2016 DAO hack. Ideologically aligned as ever, DAOhaus is a Moloch DAO and denotes on-chain memberships via membership shares (members receive this after their membership proposal is passed and processed). Recently, the DAOhaus DAO migrated to a more permissionless DAO called PublicHAUS. Anyone can stake $HAUS during an open staking period and receive governance power over the protocol. Currently, the DAO has 85 active members, and PublicHAUS has 50 champions (i.e., the governance of PublicHAUS, and by extension, of DAOhaus, is split unevenly among the 50 champions). DAOhaus currently boasts a following of 15.5k on Twitter and around 6k+ members on their Discord server at the time of writing. PublicHAUS members can update factory contracts to add fees (thereby bringing in revenue), but they haven‚Äôt chosen to do that yet. A network of smaller entities, though, offers consulting and other services around DAO setup, configuration, experiences, etc. They are revenue generating, and sometimes they also direct some revenue to PublicHAUS. Bootleggers is one such entity. When asked about any expectations that shattered with time, this is what Dekan had to say: ‚ÄúMy expectations weren‚Äôt shattered, but prolonged. Communities will, eventually, begin to demand more from their‚Äùadmins‚Äù and ask for true DAO governance. When that day comes, we will be ready.‚Äù Myosin ‚ö†Ô∏è Quick Tip Time spent sorting out your legal contracts is never wasted. Make sure payment schedules, cancellation clauses, and other fine print is discussed, agreed upon, and captured in a contract or any other legally binding document or program. Myosin is spearheading the web3 marketing revolution. They bridge the web2-web3 gap for clients through their future-proof approach that is fit for right now. Myosin is one of the few non-DeFi revenue-generating DAOs, and has helped many brands of all backgrounds navigate the terrains of an ownership economy, while also flipping the traditional digital agency model through their contributor-focussed workflows. Eschewing seasons, Myosin engages its members on a project-to-project basis. These members also get to capture a significant chunk of the value they generate (75% of all project revenue is split among the members working on the project, with 15% going to the DAO treasury and 10% going to the deal sourcer). Starting in Feb.¬†2022, the DAO has since then grown into an active community of 150 members. Membership to the DAO is overseen by its membership committee, which selects just 2 out of 100 applicants (on average). This selective process only lets in the best of the best, and is one of the main reasons behind Myosin‚Äôs enviable Discord server. Perhaps one of the most active DAO Discord servers out there, Myosin members have the longest gm streaks, and one member even coded up a Discord bot to track these streaks when the bot they were using started to falter. Of late, the DAO is focussing on Myosin Catalyst ‚Äì a program for CMOs and marketing professionals to understand the web3 opportunity and further their business interests using this technology. When asked about what he loves the most about DAOs, this is what Blake had to say: ‚ÄúWorking in a DAO is truly a global experience, and the fact that we get to work and collaborate with people all over the world, from different backgrounds, with a shared love for web3, is pretty incredible. Sometimes in meetings I realize this and have to pinch myself every now and then.‚Äù Kokonut Network ‚ö†Ô∏è Quick Tip web3 projects with an irl component to them are always tricky. They are characterized by a larger number of variables outside the team‚Äôs control. So, while accounting for unexpected delays or roadblocks is a good practice, it is imperative for web3 projects with an irl component. Kokonut Network promotes, organizes, funds, and manages coconut farms in the rural Dominican Republic. They are empowering the local communities while activating idle land and providing a way for people worldwide to directly contribute to the lives of those owning and working on these coconut farms. The team comprises five full-time and 54 DAO members who look after key areas such as development, marketing, farmer relations, and community management. Kokonut Network is a Moloch DAO and denotes on-chain membership via membership and loot shares (members receive these after clearing interviews and pledging a certain amount to the DAO treasury). The DAO has yet to generate any revenue but has made significant progress in just 16 months ‚Äì they have secured land and planting permits, got agricultural insurance, set up open-source accounting systems, and got technical support from all government agencies involved in the project framework. The team is also prepared to complete the entire planting program within eight months and is equipped to care for the trees until they start bearing fruit. Their most ambitious project, though, is creating products from the harvested coconuts and selling them. The DAO is primarily looking at beauty products, coconut milk, coconut water, and coconut pulp. These will be made available for retail and wholesale purchases. When asked if any expectations were shattered with time, Wasabi said: ‚ÄúEarly on in the history of Kokonut Network, I made several decisions from a long-term perspective that weren‚Äôt the best at the moment. After I did so, the uncertainty started to make me second-guess myself. But I was eventually proven correct over time. Today, I‚Äôm happy that I stuck to my convictions, and I know that no matter how bleak it may temporarily seem, taking a long-term perspective always pays off.‚Äù MetaGammaDelta DAO ‚ö†Ô∏è Quick Tip Things change with time, and it‚Äôs always ok to scale something back if it isn‚Äôt working. It was only when we let go of our desire to for a specific result did we notice all the interesting paths lying in front of us. MetaGammaDelta DAO bills itself as an inclusive and empowering society supporting women-led projects. Summoned at Valentine‚Äôs Day 2020 during ETH Denver, the DAO has completed more than 3 years of operations and has supported countless women-led projects since then. The DAO currently has 100 pledgees at the moment, and some of its past members have gone on to work for leading web3 organizations such as Polygon, ConsenSys, etc. In addition to funding women-led projects through grants, the DAO has prepared technical and non-technical education modules, and conducted sesssions based on these modules for members and non-members alike. MetaGammaDelta has a strong irl presence, and often hosts hackerhouses/irl side-events during marquee crypto events. Currently, the DAO is focussing on fundraising and seeking sustainable partnerships with other communities in the space. When asked if any expectations were shattered with time, QuantumAlpha said: ‚ÄúI always knew that working in a DAO would be fun, but I never knew that it‚Äôd be a lot of work as well. To top it off, not everybody you come across has the same enthusiasm for action. But overtime, I got used to it, and even got a little better and motivating others to get going and contribute!‚Äù "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
