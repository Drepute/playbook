# The Playbook in Action {-}
*We reached out to interesting communities and asked them about their journey. This is what they had to say!*

## The First 5 {-}
> *How did you get attract the earliest members of your community?*

- There was a big marketing push for token mint, so in our case the first group of members were those who were attracted to the token mint, without any pre-existing familiarity with each other. Speaking about scaling, the founding team planted the flag, but the community (mainly a small handful of community members) defined the vision. As the founding members transitioned out of the DAO, the members who put in the most work and added the most value ended up becoming the core team, and we've been steering it ever since. ***-- [Clinamenic](https://twitter.com/clinamenic)* *from* *[Lobby3](https://www.lobby3.org/)***

<p>- At the beginning of 2022, I wanted to gain more experience in web3. But like most early career folks, I was priced out of NFT communities. Shortly after, I came across [Syndicate](https://syndicate.io/) and realized that unaccredited creditors could come together in a group and invest in NFTs and tokens. </p>
<p>I saw the opportunity to create the community I wanted, and quickly sent out a feeler on Twitter about creating a group of young career professionals that would learn and invest in web3 together.</p>
<p>The idea resonated with people, and I realized this could be a DAO. Out of all those that reached out, I shortlisted five people after filtering for vibes. They all agreed to join.</p>
<p>After this, I asked one of the members to be the second interviewer, tweeted an application form, created a website, and interviewed about 100 people. This way we onboarded 35 people to Season 1 and used Syndicate to pool $1,000 each. The DAO launched in April when Jakub came on as co-founder, and itâ€™s been almost three seasons of The Symmetrical since then! ***-- [Erika](https://twitter.com/erika_echaniz) and [Jakub](https://twitter.com/jakub_rusiecki)* *from* *[The Symmetrical](https://linktr.ee/thesymmetrical)***</p>

## Culture {-}
> *How would you define your communnity's culture?*

- For starters, we all are excited by what we are doing in/through Lobby3. We also respect each other as individuals, and that has the set grounds for a stable, collaborative culture at Lobby3. One of our fun/weird rituals was doing a series of Twitter Spaces called "Statecraft on Tap" where we all drank beer and I read the Federalist Papers aloud. ***-- [Clinamenic](https://twitter.com/clinamenic)* *from* *[Lobby3](https://www.lobby3.org/)***

- We have a Twitter campaign called [Product Roasts](https://twitter.com/TheSymmetrical/status/1636028105113337856), where we give feedback to web3 products from a GenZ lens. This helped us put ourselves out there and is consistently acknowledged by product owners and the OGs in the space! We are also fortunate enough to have proactive members in almost every functional area of the DAO that keep the conversation going, so haven't had problems with community morale so far. ***-- [Erika](https://twitter.com/erika_echaniz) and [Jakub](https://twitter.com/jakub_rusiecki)* *from* *[The Symmetrical](https://linktr.ee/thesymmetrical)***

## On-chain Strategy {-}
> *What is your on-chain strategy?*

- In the original DAO, we had slightly over 800 unique tokenholders (a number which doesnâ€™t account for Sybil attacks). We used ERC-721 transferable tokens then. In the new DAO though (which will be integrated with our new legal entity) we may use non-transferable ERC-1155s or non-transferrable ERC-721s. ***-- [Clinamenic](https://twitter.com/clinamenic)* *from* *[Lobby3](https://www.lobby3.org/)***
 
- As of Season 2, the DAO has 55 members and a treasury of $52,538.61 USDC. On-chain membership to The Symmetrical requires a minimum contribution of $1,000 USDC to get $1,000 TSYM, which gives holders the right to vote among others (like attending events, participating in consulting projects, etc.) ***-- [Erika](https://twitter.com/erika_echaniz) and [Jakub](https://twitter.com/jakub_rusiecki)* *from* *[The Symmetrical](https://linktr.ee/thesymmetrical)***

## Words of Cheer {-}
> *A few words for budding or fledgling communities.*

- Get involved and experiment! This is an amazing frontier of human coordination and organization practices. ***-- [Clinamenic](https://twitter.com/clinamenic)* *from* *[Lobby3](https://www.lobby3.org/)***

- Building a community allows you to bootstrap a global network of participants around something you are passionate about. This is highly empowering and the best way to launch a web3 startup.
Start small and determine what you can do well with a small group. Scale once you have this figured out. ***-- [Erika](https://twitter.com/erika_echaniz) and [Jakub](https://twitter.com/jakub_rusiecki)* *from* *[The Symmetrical](https://linktr.ee/thesymmetrical)***
